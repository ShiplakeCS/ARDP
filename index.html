		<div>Rugby:
There is no doubt that boys get a lot of enjoyment out of rugby at the College. Teams continue to go from strength-to-strength, with the recent increase in pupil numbers contributing to Shiplake’s ongoing success. An important feature of Shiplake’s inclusive environment is that all pupils throughout the College are given the opportunity to represent their school. Multiple teams are fielded in every year group allowing every willing pupil to experience the honour of playing for Shiplake.</div>
		<div>Sports:
The major focus of school sport is on inclusivity, with multiple teams fielded in each year group to give everyone an opportunity to represent Shiplake. Timetabled ‘games’ sessions are scheduled almost every day to ensure all pupils are heavily involved in physical activity. In addition to competing in Oxfordshire and the surrounding counties, regular sports tours allow Shiplake teams to compete across the globe. These provide fantastic cultural experiences which live long in the memory. 
</div>
		<div>Rowing:
Shiplake is nationally renowned for rowing with current and former pupils representing Great Britain, including Olympic gold medallists Will Satch and Ben Hunt-Davis. The College is now working to develop a world-class rowing reputation. There are around 140 members in the Boat Club who compete throughout the season at both head races and regattas. Head races have a time trial format over distances of 4-6km. In the Summer Term, racing changes to the more exciting regatta style events with crews racing over a shorter distance but with up to six crews side by side. Highlights include the National Schools’ Regatta in May and the Henley Royal Regatta in July, where the senior 1st VIII competes every year.</div>
		<div>List Of Activities: 
</div>
		<div>Overview:
Teaching and learning occurs not only in the classroom, but across an extensive range of co-curricular pursuits in sport, music, drama and many other domains. These activities help our pupils to discover new skills in leadership, teamwork, communication and to develop the determination, resilience and confidence required to flourish in life at school and beyond. Our co-curricular programme is a crucial part of the College timetable as a means by which pupils can build character, and develop life-skills.Across the programme there is a focus on inclusivity and participation, allowing all pupils to experience a sense of achievement and progress. There are now a number of new options alongside the more traditional favourites. A balanced timetable combines academic lessons with daily co-curricular sessions dedicated to activities contributing towards each pupil’s overall personal development. This promotes the benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle and helps pupils to maintain an optimal balance between life inside and outside the classroom.

		<div>More About Catering: 
The experienced catering team at Shiplake deliver delicious meals at lunch and dinner for all pupils. There are plenty of options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike, including a diverse range of pasta sauces and healthier options including jacket potatoes, freshly made baguettes and the Shiplake salad bar. Friday is fish and chips day, accompanied by mushy peas and curry sauce at the request of the Headmaster. Boarders are also provided with a range of breakfast options. 

Pupils always give glowing feedback about the food on offer at Shiplake, including those from visiting schools who often cite the ‘match teas’ as the highlight of sporting fixtures played at the College!
</div>
		<div>Food At Shiplake:
All catering at Shiplake College is provided by bespoke and unique catering company Thomas Franks. The Thomas Franks team specialise in catering for independent schools, including all special events and fine dining services. They have a passion for food, professionally presented through excellent service by using fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The catering manager is always experimenting with new ideas and rotates menus frequently to ensure there are always new dishes for pupils to try. The standard of food and service is taken to an even higher level for special events throughout the Shiplake calendar, where guests are treated to culinary delights including roast duck and fillet of beef.</div>
		<div>Contact with family:
Mobile phones, email and Skype make regular communication with home easy and the Parent Portal keeps parents fully informed of their child’s educational progress. Friends and family are welcome to visit, and are actively encouraged to take a full and active part of the boarder’s life. Many parents, particularly those who live about an hour from the College, are able to attend concerts, performances or sports fixtures, or may occasionally choose to take their child out for dinner during the week.</div>
		<div>Boarding:
Boarding is an integral part of life at Shiplake. Full, weekly, flexi-boarding and overnight stays allows pupils to fully benefit from all the academic and co-curricular opportunities that we offer. With no 'daily commute', boarders can dedicate more time to academic and leisure pursuits. Our boarders join from many parts of Britain, with about 5% coming from overseas. Together they make up a busy and vibrant community, who are proud to call Shiplake College 'home'. 
The College provides a secure and supportive environment in which pupils learn to live together happily, grow in confidence and achieve success and enjoyment in all aspects of school life. We see the boarding environment as a key way to foster the complementary values of social tolerance and inclusiveness. Boarders quickly come to regard their House as a home away from home and boarding enables them to develop key skills, including independence, self-reliance and getting on with others, which will stand them in good stead later in life.
</div>
		<div>More On Activities:
Sky Sports 1 is often the channel of choice, especially on weekends where boys tune in to catch the latest sporting events. The ongoing refurbishment programme is also serving to upgrade a number of rooms and dormitories. The House is wireless networked throughout, and there is a pool table room where competitions are held every Tuesday evening. Other evening events include card games, backgammon and a weekly quiz night, while at weekends boarders enjoy a range of activities including ice-skating, go-karting, wake-boarding and day trips. Fitness fanatics enjoy using Burr’s new cardiovascular gym.</div>
		<div>About Boarding Activites: 
Whilst day pupils and weekly boarders are ordinarily free to go home after their games and sporting commitments on Saturdays, many boarders choose to remain at the College and make use of the College’s fantastic grounds and facilities, or relax after their busy weeks. Supervision of boys is taken care of centrally by Housemasters and senior tutors on a rota system.Our dedicated Boarding Activities Co-ordinator, Mr Tiki Ebun-Cole, organises a variety of events and activities for boarders who stay in over the weekend. The activities programme covers a mixture of cultural, social and sporting events. On Sundays, boarders are allowed a ‘lie-in’ or have personal time until brunch at 11.30am. Sunday afternoons are reserved for more active activities, in which all boarders are strongly encouraged to take part.
</div>
		<div>Orchard House is situated at the forefront of the College overlooking the award-winning, 1st XI cricket pitch. Orchard is home to 75 day boys from Year 9 to Year 12, spread across 3 floors of a wonderfully maintained, modern building. Year 13 boys and girls live in close proximity in College and Gilson Houses respectively.

The magnificent cricket pavilion is part of the House, allowing pupils to enjoy using it as their common room at break and lunchtimes. There is also a games room with pool tables and table football. With no boarders, space in the House is dedicated to providing light and spacious work environments where pupils can complete their prep.

Although one of the largest houses at Shiplake, Orchard still manages to be a welcoming and friendly home that offers every boy a small corner that they can call their own. The house is run as one big family, with all teaching staff and senior students playing their part to create an atmosphere which is based upon mutual respect, tolerance and the support of each other in times of joy, and sadness.

		<div>The Skipwith population is made up of predominantly day pupils, with a number of flexi-boarders and Sixth Form girls. Despite the transition to accommodate more day pupils, the traditional boarding ethos of the house is still very much present. An increasing number of pupils are choosing to take advantage of Shiplake’s convenient flexi-boarding options. House staff endeavour to create a welcoming environment and take a holistic approach to the pastoral care and academic progress of all boys.
In September 2014, Mr Alex Duncan became Housemaster of Skipwith. Alex lives on site with his wife Charlotte and their two sons, Oliver and Torin, having arrived at Shiplake in 2013 with twelve years of Geography teaching experience. Mr Duncan held numerous leadership roles in previous schools, including Head of Department and Head of Year. He is now enjoying working as a Housemaster.

		<div>Everett House is located above the College reception, with magnificent views of the River Thames. The modern House accommodates approximately 55 pupils, predominantly made up of full and weekly boarders. A small number of day pupils have joined Everett in recent years which has added an extra dimension to the energetic House dynamic.

Mr Tom Armstrong became Housemaster of Everett in September 2014. Mr Armstrong joined the English Department at Shiplake in September 2011, and has enjoyed a successful first four years at the College. He lives on site with his wife Emma, son Ruaridh, and their black Labrador Tally.

Everett has a friendly and informal atmosphere, with two common rooms providing plenty of space to relax, along with a pool room and games consoles. House staff strive to provide a homely and welcoming atmosphere in which the boys can explore new opportunities, find out their strengths, be supported in their weaknesses and have their achievements celebrated. The House offers a ‘home away from home’ environment that is so important in a boarding school. It is a place where individuality is welcomed, and a community to which all members are proud to belong.
</div>
		<div>Sports Hall</div>
		<div>As a Church of England school, pupils at Shiplake are gently encouraged to lead an active spiritual life throughout their time at the College.

The College neighbours the Shiplake Parish Church, which provides an ideal venue for regular periods of reflection and worship. The College Chaplain is Reverend Stephen Cousins. “The Rev”, as he is known to everyone, is responsible for leading the weekly chapel services which are held in the morning before the start of academic lessons. Chapels are split into senior and junior services, with pupils attending one per week. Weekly assemblies are also held in the Parish Church.

The Rev aims to keep services reasonably short, informal and interactive, as we believe it is important for pupils to come together for this act of collective worship. Other special services are organised throughout the year such as Harvest Festival, Remembrance Day, Christmas, Easter, Ascension Day and many more. An optional communion takes place on Friday mornings and on Wednesday evenings there is House Communion, which operates on a rotation basis.

		<div>New TextBurr House accommodates approximately 50 pupils, with a combination of full and weekly boarders, as well as day pupils, ranging from Year 9 to Year 12. Burr is centrally located on the College campus, adjacent to the main drive of the College opposite the brand new John Turner Building.
Mr Andy Dix has been Housemaster of Burr House since 2012, and lives in the House with his wife Sarah and their three children. Andy teaches Physical Education and Mathematics and also holds the position of Senior Housemaster. He is interested in a range of sports including rugby, golf, cricket and hockey, and is also partial to a bit of staff football when time allows.

Andy is supported by matrons Mrs Jennie Miles-Thomas and Mrs Sandra Jeffs, and an enthusiastic team of visiting tutors. In September 2014, Head of Psychology Mr Richard Ebbage took over as Assistant Housemaster. In addition to teaching, Richard enjoys coaching the football 1st XI. Burr House staff are passionate about creating a homely environment for the boys who live there for prolonged periods of time.

		<div>Gilson House</div>
		<div>In addition to an excellent academic department offering pupils the opportunity to study Drama at GCSE and A Level, there are a range of additional opportunities for passionate young performers to explore and experiment with the subject beyond the constraints of the curriculum.


Dramatists at Shiplake College have sole use of the Tithe Barn Theatre, located in the listed Stableyard area of the College campus. The intimate venue thrusts performers in and amongst audience members to create an enthralling atmosphere for productions.

Pupils are often encouraged to experiment with imaginative staging designs to fully utilise the space available. Shiplake actors and actresses have gained a reputation for producing challenging, fearless performances often in unusual spaces
</div>
		<div>Around 50 pupils belong to Welsh House, which is located at the top of the main drive adjacent to the College entrance. The Welsh cohort currently consists of a relatively even split between full boarders, weekly boarders and day pupils, although this can vary slightly from year to year.
Set away from the main teaching areas, the House has a peaceful setting which gives its residents a feeling of leaving College at the end of each day even though they remain on site. Welsh pupils are a tight-knit, happy and prosperous community, who enjoy spending time together as well as integrating with the rest of the College. Excellence is celebrated both in academia and in co-curricular activities, with all talents valued equally whether they are in Art, Music, Drama, Sport or any other field.

The House has two spacious common rooms where pupils like to spend their break times during the day. The large House kitchen always provides a regular supply of toast, which is ranked alongside gas and electricity in terms of importance to keep the House going! There are also computing facilities and a games room with a stylish pool table and table football. A tennis court adjoins the House garden, where gatherings and barbecues are held. Bedrooms and study rooms are generally shared by pupils in Years 9-11, but single rooms are available for more senior boys.

		<div>Sport is a central part of Shiplake life. Lush, expansive grounds provide a perfect setting for sports fixtures throughout the year, while our thriving Boat Club enjoys easy access to our very own stretch of the River Thames.

The high quality facilities allow pupils to enjoy representing their school and further enhancing Shiplake’s proud sporting reputation. Although we are relatively small in terms of pupil numbers, we have a reputation for ‘punching above our weight’ across various sports. Many of our staff possess impressive sporting pedigrees of their own, which has helped to develop a strong coaching team and allow Shiplake pupils to realise their potential. Several boys and girls have gone on to reach regional and national level.

That said, the major focus of school sport is on inclusivity, with multiple teams fielded in each year group to give everyone an opportunity to represent Shiplake. Timetabled ‘games’ sessions are scheduled almost every day to ensure all pupils are heavily involved in physical activity.

In addition to competing in Oxfordshire and the surrounding counties, regular sports tours allow Shiplake teams to compete across the globe. These provide fantastic cultural experiences which live long in the memory.

		<div>Gilson House
</div>
		<div>Orchard House
</div>
		<div>All girls at Shiplake join Gilson House, a dedicated girls’ house which opened in September 2009. The College’s newest House provides modern, purpose-built accommodation for a mixture of day and boarding pupils. At present, 33 girls are part of our Sixth Form, with an approximate 60:40 split between boarders and day girls.

Gilson’s Housemistress is Miss Suzy Andrew, who also teaches Art at the College. Suzy is supported by Deputy Housemistress Mrs Sian Pearson, who joined the team in Gilson in 2016, having previously worked as Assistant Housemistress in Skipwith. Mrs Lou Porter is the matron for Gilson, providing the girls with domestic and pastoral support. A friendly team of visiting tutors make up the rest of the team. Suzy has been at Shiplake since 2007, and served as Resident Tutor before becoming Housemistress. Sian has been at Shiplake since 2013 and is the next port of call for the girls if the Housemistress is not available. Together, the team of staff provide the girls with a wealth of support across all academic and co-curricular domains. 

If you are a boarding girl you will have your own study bedroom, and if you are a day girl you will have either a single or double study room, with plenty of storage and desk space to provide a suitable working and living environment. Every effort is made to ensure that girls have the best opportunity to maximise their potential academically, culturally and socially. There are ample shared bathroom facilities for girls to use, whilst the Head of House and another senior prefect are rewarded with an en suite bathroom.

		<div>College House:In their final year at Shiplake, all boys move to College House. Students in College House are granted greater independence, as a reflection of their increasing maturity. Consequently, they are encouraged to take greater responsibility for themselves academically and socially. This unique element of the House system at Shiplake College provides a valuable stepping stone between school and university or work. Boys continue their association with their original Houses; helping with duties and playing an active role in the various Inter-House competitions.

</div>
		<div>Lower School: Boys in Year 7 and Year 8 belong to our Lower School. The Lower School opened in 2009, originally with 18 pupils. Since then, the School has gone from strength to strength and is now home to over 50 boys.


The modern, purpose-built Lower School building has a thriving and bustling environment which provides the perfect stepping stone between junior or prep school and Year 9 at Shiplake College. Staff have instilled a wholly inclusive philosophy, allowing all boys the opportunity to sample everything that Shiplake has to offer.
